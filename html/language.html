                        <p id="python">Python was made by Dutch programmer Guido Van Rossum in the late 1980s. At the
                            time, he was working on a distributed system called Amoeba at CWI, a computer science
                            research center in the Netherlands. C was the primary language he and the other researchers
                            used.
                            Van Rossum felt that programming with C was **too time consuming*8. He began to create a new
                            language in his free time that would let him work faster. Little did he know that this side
                            project would eventually become one of the most popular, widespread programming languages in
                            the world.
                            The appeal of Python has always been its simplicity and unique mixture of C with bash script
                            capabilities. Van Rossum drew heavily on the ABC programming language but included tools for
                            dynamic types and imperative programming as well.</p>

                        <p id="java">Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is
                            designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose
                            programming language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning
                            that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to
                            recompile. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java
                            virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java
                            is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.</p>

                        <p id="cpp">The C++ programming language has a history going back to 1979, when Bjarne
                            Stroustrup was doing work for his Ph.D. thesis. One of the languages Stroustrup had the
                            opportunity to work with was a language called Simula, which as the name implies is a
                            language primarily designed for simulations. The Simula 67 language - which was the variant
                            that Stroustrup worked with - is regarded as the first language to support the
                            object-oriented programming paradigm. Stroustrup found that this paradigm was very useful
                            for software development, however the Simula language was far too slow for practical use.
